  UPHOLDING THE PROTESTANT CONVICTION OF SOLA SCRIPTURA (“BIBLE ONLY”), THESE 28 FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS DESCRIBE HOW SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS INTERPRET SCRIPTURE FOR DAILY APPLICATION. Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed and hold certain fundamental beliefs to be the teaching of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set forth here, constitute the church’s understanding and expression of the teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be expected at a quinquennial General Conference Session whenever the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth, or if better language is found to express these teachings of God’s Holy Word. The expression of these concepts help provide an overall picture of what this Christian denomination collectively believes and practices. Together, these teachings reveal a God who is the architect of the world. In wisdom, grace and infinite love, He is actively working to restore a relationship with humanity that will last for eternity. The 28 Fundamental Beliefs can be organized into six categories of doctrine: God, man, salvation, the church, daily Christian life, and last-day events (restoration).
