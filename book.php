        From the start of Jacob"s existence, it imprints a dysfunctional struggle from the womb of Rebekah. It was a twin in whom they ounger is stronger than the eldest. A familial environment
practices favoritism that produced dissention and alienation of Esau and Jacob.
        The rift started with the birthright, of which the eldest should have been titled of the father"s blessing and a manifold of inheritance. The family was residing in Beersheba. Jacob greedily snatched the possession of which he was not eligible. In obtaining the birthright, he thought that it could be gained through trickery and dishonesty.
        Jacob"s deception, which he conspired with his mother, brought many years of being haunted by a guilty conscience. The virus of deceit carried its contagious effect in dealing with his father-in-law in herding his sheep. It accumulated piles of deceitful pursuit, which shackledhim.The decrescendo of Jacob"s life portrayed the need of grace for redemption and God afforded that provision. God provided an upward scale of which Jesus has provided the way so that all present-day Jacobs may experience His saving act.
        There were two significant places in Jacob"s story: Jabbok, the place where he was alone after he let his family cross the river, and Peniel,the place where he wrestled with God and he had seen Him face to face. Jacob struggled not to release himself until he was wounded bygrace.He overcame but hurt his hip as a result. To lose ourselves and gain the Source of life is worth everypain.Jacob was a conqueror by the blessing of God and, later, was called Israel.
        Sometimes, like Jacob, we are in Beersheba, where we compete for position and favor. Alternatively, in Peniel, wrestling, struggling,and hurting. No matter what difficulties you may face, or what you are going through, seek God and place your faith in Him. Because of Jesus,overwhelming victory can be yours. In fact, you can be more than a conqueror, too.</p>';

                  In addition, the boy went home and told his father about the woman who wanted to buy the rock for S2. He went to the museum and a man wanted to buy the rock.

He brought the precious stone to the jeweler.
                  "Where did you find this stone? It is one of the rarest stones in the world! How much would you sell it for?" the owner exclaimed. The boy stayed silent but he raised his two fingers up and the man said, "I take it for $200,000!" The boy not knowing what to say ran home to his father.

        Jesus said that when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel' (Matt 19:28, NIV). 
        The disciples understood the statement literally. They thought that Jesus would deliver them from the Roman rule, restore the Davidic
kingdom, and reign as a new king with all the glory they experienced under King Solomon. Jesus made it clear to them that whoever wants
to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave (v. 26, NIV).
        The word servant implies a voluntary service. The disciples missed Jesus' crucial point here that greatness must come from it. He is
contrasting selfishness and selflessness. A selfish person is consumed with greediness--to possess power, to own riches, and to enjoy
notoriety, and above all, to demand service from men.
        However, a selfless one tries to give and to serve just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his Ife as a ransom for many' (v. 27, NIV).

          Everyone deserves chances. If we do not give others chances, we prevent them from growing. Being imperfect is not something that we should be sad. To fail in something is not the end of everything. We should be glad because when we fail we still have the opportunity to grow--to develop ourselves.
          Our text tells us that Jesus is not a fan of second chances but of unlimited chances to grow. Peter wanted to develop a definite time
period to forgive others--wanted it only 'up to seven times.' But God's love is infinite. Instead of doing it 'seven times,' he answered Peter to do it 'seventy-seven times (NIV). Other Bible translates it as 'seventy times seven'(NASU, NLT, ESV, KJV, NKJV, etc.), which coincides to the original Greek.
      Jesus' seventy times seven does not mean that we have the maximum of 490 times to give chances to others. It is an idea that any
second chance is not enough. We should give unlimited chances to erring but improving individuals. Jesus did it to Peter so many times.
Thus, Jesus wanted that he should do the same.
          How do you forgive others? Have patience in giving chances to erring people. As long as they are improving, do forgiving unlimitedly. Lord God, please help us to forgive others the way You want us to do. Amen!</p>";

                  Five loaves of bread and two fish satisfied five thousand people. At the end, the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and of the fish. It was totally amazing!
                  After the feeding, Jesus said, 'Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted' (John 6:12). E. G. White says, 'These
        words meant more than that the disciples should gather the broken pieces of bread into baskets. Jesus meant that they should mark His
        words, should study the Scriptures, and treasure every ray of light. Instead of searching for a knowledge of something that God had not revealed, they were carefully to gather up what He had given them' (CTr 250).
                   When did the multiplication take place? Was it after Jesus' prayer; during the distribution or after the bread and fish were given to the
        people? Jesus' prayer is an essential part of the event. After it, the food was worthy to be distributed. However, it remained five loaves of bread and two fish after the prayer. No more, no less! It only multiplied when the disciples started to divide it.
                   This truth is crucial: multiplication of everything start by dividing it and be given to those in need. Will you divide what you have today?

        The devil loves to see God's church asleep. He wanted to see us 'in a state of inactivity, to keep them from acting their part in spreading
the truth, that they may at last be weighed in the balance and found wanting' (1T260). In fact, *continued inactivity is one of the greatest
causes of debility of body and feebleness of mind' (HL 134). Finally, 'inactivity is registered in the books of heaven as opposition to Christ's

        echo "<p>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indecd is willing, but the flesh is weak.—Matt 26:41, KJV

        One of the shameful things in this world is committing for something that you cannot fulfill, it is a broken commitment. Simon Peter, one of the disciples, confidently said to Jesus,
        'Lord, though all men shall be offended because of You, Yet Iwill never be offended. Lord, though I should die with You, yet I will never deny You' (Matt 26: 31-35, KJV).
                  In the experience of Peter, we can find three reasons why commitment slips and tumbles.
                  First, Peter relied on his own strength. He has the confidence to do something for Jesus, but there is no dependence on God. He had
        the good intentions but there was no action, and there was godliness in his heart but there was no power in his life- because he trusted his
        own ability.
                  Second, Peter and the other two disciples failed to pray (Matt 26:37-41 ). Jesus went to the garden of Gethsemane, together with
        Peter, James, and John. Jesus asked them to pray as He walked a bit away from them. When He came back, He found them sleeping. When
        we lack prayer, we lack or no power at all.
                  Lastly, Peter doubted the power of God (Matt 26: 69-74). Peter denied Christ thrice. This was a result of his lack of faith. In the last
        verse of Matthew 26, we find there that Peter wept bitterly, it means He recognized his mistakes, and he humbled himself. Peter's commitment was broken, but Jesus restored it and Peter consistently followed Christ
        until his death.

                  Jesus can recognize any casual contact of the careless multitude—any touch of faith amidst any crowded situation. A large crowd mayhinder us from talking to Jesus. Nevertheless, a touch through faith is always recognizable.
                  Jesus desired that the woman should acknowledge the blessing she received from the Lord. The woman should confess the goodness of the Lord. Upon hearing the Savior's inquiry, the woman could not help but throw herself, trembling at His feet. Tears fell from woman's weary eyes. At the feet of Jesus, the woman found relief after telling the story of her own suffering. Gladly, Jesus had so much time to listen to her.
                  With a gentle voice, Jesus said to the woman that her faith healed her (v. 48). The healing 'was not through the outward contact with Him, but through the faith which took hold on His divine power, that the cure was wrought' (CC 298).

        He knew everything that they faced right then. From the human standpoint, they were in great danger. The storm could have sunk their boat anytime and left them dead in the lake. That is the reason why the disciples went down and woke Jesus up. 
        Nevertheless, Jesus was not concerned about the storm. It was not an issue to Him. He could command the storm to obey him. He could
sleep very well amidst the stormy sea. In fact, when Jesus got up, He immediately rebuked the wind and raging waters. The storm subsided and all was calm (v. 24).
        The question is: What Jesus is most concerned of at this time? Obviously, Jesus was most concerned of their faith. He did not say, 'Where is the storm?' Rather, 'where is your faith?' (v. 25, NIV).

                 Authority is essential in one's life. If handled prudently, it brings blessings, however many utilize it for personal benefits. During Jesus' time, the priest claimed their authority from the Levitical lineage-the
        tribe that was set apart to serve in the temple. The elders of Israel claimed their authority from being chosen as leaders of their clans and families. These clusters of religious and social influential were sure of their authority and were not afraid to challenge Jesus! They would like to place Jesus in a predicament. Nevertheless, their question was countered with another query that made them mum (vs 3-8).
                 Jesus had the best Source of authority that provided Him the advantage, power, and even respect of many people as He faced His
        detractors. There are two things we can do to obtain well-grounded and substantial authority.
                  First, make that Source the Authority of our life. Choosing God as the Manager of our daily endeavors will afford us the exceptional advantage in facing life's challenges.

Almost 20 million people die each year of starvation or hunger-related illnesses and most of them are children. Seventh-day Adventists are transforming agents in their communities after Jesus’ ministry of compassion (Luke 4:16- 21: MH, 143). God wants us to serve the community especially helping the poor and needy. It is one of the most powerful means to show God's love to people.
        When we humble ourselves, we desire what God desires. Since God's passion is compassion, He wants us to give the same thing to those who are poor—people in need. A heart that is pure towards God is not indifferent to his or her fellow human beings. God cares about human sufferings. So, we should have a sense of responsibility to these
  people. 
        Doing passion projects to help the poor is a great testimony about the God we serve. An act of social concern is a testimony of the truth that we are being made in Christ's likeness day by day. As Jesus laid down His life for us, we should also lay down our lives for others.
