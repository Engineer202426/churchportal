The Bible introduces God as Creator. It is an contrast to the evolutionist view that our world is a result of an evolutionary process that took place after millions of years. Our text for today speaks that God supernaturally created the universe. By just commanding, everything stoodfast (Ps 33:9). He was not dependent on any existing matter when the world was created. God created the Earth to be inhabited by His creatures. Again, this is in contrast to the purposelessness of the evolutionary theory, which insists that the universe is just accidental. Moreover, the keeping of the Sabbath is just a gesture of a gratitude to God as the Creator. The underlying principle is: God “made the heavens and the earth, the sea, amd all that is in them” (Exod 20:11). In fact, Revelation echoes the same concern, which says, “Worship him who made the heavens, the eart, the sea and the springs of water” (Rev 14:7). Thus, we worship God on the Sabbath day because we recognize Him as the Creator of the univers. Evolutionists cannot do this gesture of gratefulness of His creatorship. In fact, evolutionalists deny this very essence of man’s existence. Aside from keeping thr Seventh-day Sabbath, what do you think is the best gesture of gratefulness that you practice to recognize God’s creatorship in your life today? May I suggest you start reading the whole bible and discover it from the very Ancient Words—Scriptures Lord God, thank You for creating me and this world for me. I promise to keep Your Sabbath as an expression of my gratitude of Your creative-redemptive power.
